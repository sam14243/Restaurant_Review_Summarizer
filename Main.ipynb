She tried to fob us off istead of finding out from kitchen for the delay - ultimately she did tht but it was too late for us as we had waited far too long. what was to be an enjoyable evening, it turned out to be a terrible one! Iam afraid non-of us will be visiting this restaurant again! There are plenty of good restaurants  locally with much better service!More',\n",
       " \"The food is nice. Tasty. The menu doesnt really explain much so I don't think they are catering for a wide audience.  Food price is fair but price of non-alcoholic drinks is outrageous. The quantity of the meals was good.  Service isn't that good\",\n",
       " 'Ordered lunch for 30 people, they responded to my calls and messages and I discussed with Kalyani about the order until closer to the actual date and then she totally vanished and stopped communicating. I had to order from elsewhere in the last minute. Will...not recommend A2BMore',\n",
       " 'As soon as we saw the new restaurant, we went inside. Table was provided immediately,  but to serve us it took more than 1/2 an hour. After ordering it took another 1/2 hour for the food. Even we thought, we should leave and go to...Saravanabhavan our usual restaurant. The girls were pleasant, but the time it took was unbelievable. Whether we will come back to this restaurant is a question mark.More',\n",
       " 'Absolutely very bad service. When I reached,I asked for table a staff told me there is 3 available but it was a reservation I waited for 10 minutes and another staff came straight away they even didn’t have  any reservations but still got a table....Finally l\\ngot a  table but they didn’t provide any tissues. When l asked she said ‘we don’t provide’!!! They provided the nan before the curry so when we got our curry the nan was super cold.When l took a take a way box we asked for a bag which they charged . This was a bad experience!!!!More',\n",
       " 'Found it way too much sauce and too spicy! Cauliflower was mushy in the Manchurian and paneer was harder than should be in Manchurian.\\nOne thing good is quantity is great!',\n",
       " \"I had pathetic experience with Aadyar. I love South Indian food so thought to try a new restaurant.They sopiled our dinner.Service was very bad and food quality doesn't deserve price I paid for.I strongly recommend not to visit the Adyar restaurant.\",\n",
       " 'First and last time visit. Would not recommend. After a fairly pleasant invite in, we were seated and order taken, which we took the waiters recommendation of dosa & juice drinks. One drink arrived, the other after three reminders 30 mins later. Dosa was miserly...filled. Overall very poor customer service and not value for money. Very disappointing.More',\n",
       " 'I was there with a friend for lunch and don’t think will go again.\\nWe ordered chat and dosa and the waitress brought the dosa first and when asked she said that she forgot without any apologies.\\nDosa was average and sambar wasn’t enough to...last a dosa.\\nThe chat was not tasty and the papri had gone soft. \\nService was poor and no one came to ask how everything was.More',\n",
